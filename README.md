# WARNING
This repo is currently broken and will not run/build properly unless certain packages are installed and an unknown change is made to the assets folder.
This is not intentional, we are working on fixing it eventually but until then this warning will stay on here.
The source code is completely untouched by this circumstance, however.

# Jammer Dash
Jammer Dash is a 2D Rhythm game made with Unity, with hopes of the best user experience and the best community ever.

## Why is Jammer Dash open source?
Jammer Dash originally never was planned to be open source. But because we want to show the community how Jammer Dash runs, and to also make the community find bugs and issues to help improve, we made the game open source.

## Is there Mac, Linux support?
Sadly no, but we hope to be able to allow support in the future.
