# Jammer Dash
Jammer Dash is a 2D Rhythm game made with Unity, with hopes of the best user experience and the best community ever.

## Why is Jammer Dash open source?
Jammer Dash originally never was planned to be open source. But because we want to show the community how Jammer Dash runs, and to also make the community find bugs and issues to help improve, we made the game open source.

## Is there Mac, Linux support?
We try to make Mac and Linux work well, so that's why we work with the community to fix platform-specific bugs and also try to get the game on most platforms, as well as optimize the game. The game is always original for Windows, so porting the game is a complicated process.
